Rperform
--------

Rperform is an R package that makes it easy for R package developers to track quantitative performance metrics of their code, over time. <b>It focuses on providing changes brought over in the packageâ€™s performance metrics over subsequent development versions, most importantly relating to time and memory.</b>
<em>The project is under development, as a part of the [Google Summer of Code 2015](https://github.com/rstats-gsoc/gsoc2015/wiki/Test-timings-on-Travis) program.</em>

Installation
------------

To get started, you can install the package from github using `devtools`.

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github("da-ta-vinci21/Rperform")
```

Examples
--------

The following example illustrates the use of the <em>Rpeform::get_times()</em> function on the git repository
of the package [stringr](https://github.com/tdhock/stringr).

```r
> setwd("./stringr")
> get_times(test_path = "./tests/testthat/test-split.r", num_commits = 1)
